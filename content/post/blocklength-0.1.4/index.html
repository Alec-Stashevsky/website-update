<p>Iâ€™m excited to announce that <code>blocklength</code> 0.1.4 is now available on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=blocklength">CRAN</a>! <code>blocklength</code> is designed to be used with block-bootstrap procedures and makes it quick and easy to select a block-length quantitatively.</p>
<p>Install it with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;blocklength&quot;)</code></pre>
