<p>Last week I got the opportunity to share how we are using <a href="https://www.pyg.org/">PyTorch Geometric</a> at <a href="https://fetch.com/">Fetch</a> as their very first industrial use-case presentation! PyTorch Geometric (PyG) is an open source deep learning library for graphs and other geometries. Check out the talk below.</p>
